A Weibo client written by Electron.

## Background

I want to use Weibo on desktop. But I don't like the web version. So I decide to build one by myself.

**It's just a practice project.**

## TODO

- Add main page, show weibo timeline
- Show retweet weibo

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egbertwong/ElectronWeibo.git
cd ElectronWeibo
npm install
npm start
```
